<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a young graduate with a strong academic background in Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning. </p>

<p>In recent months, I have worked on Data visualizations, Machine learning, and Network science projects.</p>

<p>I am highly proficient in Python programming language and Matlab and for a while now I have been working on inverse problems(recovering true images from blurred or noisy images). I have a great interest in research, learning new skills, and applying what I know to the real world.</p>

<p>Currently, I am seeking internship opportunities in Data Science, ML, Software Engineering, and AI.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I play World of Tanks video games!</p>
