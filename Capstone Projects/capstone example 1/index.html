        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>I am a young graduate with a strong academic background in Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning. 
            In recent months, I have worked on Data visualizations, Machine learning, and Network science projects.</p>
            
        <p>I am highly proficient in Python programming language and Matlab and for a while now I have been working on inverse problems(recovering true images from blurred or noisy images). I have a great interest in research, learning new skills, and applying what I know to the real world.</p>
            
        <p>Currently, I am seeking internship opportunities in Data Science, ML, Software Engineering, and AI.</p>
